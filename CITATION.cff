abstract: >-
  Arbitrium Framework is an open-source Python framework for
  high-stakes AI decision-making via tournament-based model
  synthesis. Unlike general-purpose agent frameworks,
  Arbitrium uses competitive elimination tournaments where AI
  agents generate independent solutions, critique each other,
  compete in evaluation rounds, and progressively refine
  until a champion emerges. The Knowledge Bank innovation
  preserves insights from eliminated models, ensuring no
  valuable perspective is lost.
